Task: Build the Fix Eagle website from the filebin assets, following the
design-taste-frontend and hallmark skills, then push to GitHub and deploy to
Vercel.

Work Log:
- Downloaded all 4 assets from filebin (brand zip, company profile PDF,
  website plan, proposal). Read the website plan and extracted full profile
  text as the content source of truth.
- Ran `npx skills use` for design-taste-frontend and hallmark; read both
  SKILL.md outputs completely plus the hallmark references (editorial genre,
  macrostructures index + photographic, component cookbook picks N9/Ft5/F4/T4,
  typography, color, layout, motion, copy, anti-patterns, microinteractions,
  responsive, custom-theme, slop-test).
- Design decision: genre editorial (luxury lean), custom tuned theme anchored
  on brand gold #CDA666, macrostructure 08 Photographic, nav N9-derived
  edge-aligned, footer Ft5 statement, fonts Cormorant Garamond (display) +
  Switzer (body, self-hosted from Fontshare).
- Ran the fullstack-dev init script; scaffolded on Next.js 16 + Tailwind 4.
- Asset pipeline (scripts/process-assets.mjs): 16 photos optimized to
  max-1920px mozjpeg q80, logo exports, favicons (icon.png 512 + apple-icon
  180), OG image 1200x630 composed from the eagle portrait.
- Built the design system in src/app/tokens.css + globals.css: OKLCH palette
  (warm ivory paper, charcoal ink, single gold accent), 4pt spacing, motion
  tokens, hairline system, sharp corners, print-register components.
- Built 14 routes: home (photographic hero + stats + services index + sale
  channels + case studies + process + about teaser), services, process,
  case studies (reference table), about, faq (accordion + FAQPage JSON-LD),
  contact (WhatsApp-first composer with validation), thank-you, privacy,
  terms, disclaimer, brand, 404, error. Plus robots.ts, sitemap.ts,
  manifest.ts, AuctionHouse JSON-LD on home.
- Verified with agent-browser: all pages 200, no console errors, no
  horizontal scroll at 320/375/768/1440, mobile menu navigation, FAQ
  accordion, contact form validation + WhatsApp handoff (prefilled message
  confirmed), dark mode toggle, lazy images load on scroll.
- VLM design audits (5 passes): caught and fixed fonts not resolving
  (next/font variables moved to <html>), muted text contrast (darkened to
  oklch 38%), photo figure position bug (relative wrapper), robots.txt
  conflict with scaffold public file, deprecated middleware convention
  (renamed to proxy.ts).
- Added src/proxy.ts preview guard: non-production hosts get X-Robots-Tag
  noindex.

Stage Summary:
- Site verified working end to end in dev; lint clean; tsc clean for src/.
- All facts sourced from the company profile; zero em dashes; no fabricated
  stats. Footer carries the Tangison Studio credit and copyright.
- Next: commit, push to GitHub (PAT provided), deploy to Vercel (token
  provided).

Task: GitHub push and Vercel deployment.

Work Log:
- Created github.com/tangison/fix-eagle (PAT auth), untracked the scaffold
  .env, pushed main.
- Created Vercel project fix-eagle (team targis47s-projects) git-linked to
  the repo, production branch main.
- Debugged production 404s: root cause was output:"standalone" plus the
  self-hosting build script (cp into .next/standalone). Dropped both, set
  project framework to nextjs. Deploys green since commit 5cd0bf1.
- Relaxed project ssoProtection from all_except_custom_domains to preview
  scope, then to disabled, so the production vercel.app URL is publicly
  reachable.
- Perf pass: slimmed favicon (204KB to 23KB), manifest icon now a 192px
  variant (was the 219KB raw logo), dropped the unused Cormorant 700 weight,
  hero quality 82, AVIF-first image formats. First-load now ~470KB.
- Verified live: all 14 routes plus SEO endpoints 200, 404 works, contact
  form hands off to WhatsApp with prefilled message, fonts loaded, no
  console errors.
- Contrast verified numerically: all text tokens exceed WCAG AAA
  (muted 9.14:1, ink 14.8:1, links 6.04:1, photo text 16:1).

Stage Summary:
- Live at https://fix-eagle-targis47s-projects.vercel.app (auto-deploys
  from GitHub main).
- Preview guard: non-production hosts carry X-Robots-Tag noindex until
  fixeagleinvestments.com is connected (set PRODUCTION_HOST env var or
  update src/proxy.ts).

Task ID: 3
Agent: Super Z (main agent)
Task: Revision round per client feedback: Target.com typography bar,
Collins hamburger menu, widgets, brown theme, wordmark fix.

Work Log:
- Re-fetched the filebin (still live); recovered exact brand codes:
  gold #CDA666, charcoal #393936, slate-navy #44536A (headings),
  orange #EC7C30 (sparing), white base.
- Studied the bars live: extracted Target's font ("Helvetica for
  Target", weights 400/500/600/700/800) from their CSS; screenshotted
  and measured the wearecollins.com menu (72px links, #140700 overlay,
  two-line icon, featured column, pill CTA).
- Typography: self-hosted Inter variable (closest world-class match),
  single family, 400 body / 700 headings / 800 hero; pill CTAs.
- Wordmark: FIX EAGLE / AUCTIONEERS (Investments removed, header and
  footer); trading name kept in metadata and legal lines.
- Palette re-anchored on the exact brand hexes; headings slate-navy,
  ink charcoal, links deep gold #7A5E22; brown theme (.theme-brown,
  cocoa #2E261B ground, ivory text, gold headings) on privacy, terms,
  disclaimer, brand only; header joins the brown ground via :has().
- Widgets: Collins-style full-screen menu overlay on all viewports
  (staggered links, featured work, gold pill CTA); desktop mega
  dropdowns (Services, Company) with hover intent; channel tabs;
  process tabs; embla case-study carousel (arrows above, gold dots);
  sector filter dropdown; services accordion; count of text cut hard
  across home/services/process/about.
- Three production bugs found and fixed: (1) hero text invisible:
  Tailwind cannot infer text-[var(--photo-ink)] as color next to a
  text-[length] utility, plus unlayered base CSS overriding layered
  utilities (moved base into @layer base, real .photo-text classes);
  (2) text-muted resolving to the shadcn surface token (--color-muted:
  var(--paper-2)) so all muted text rendered near-white on white
  (renamed token to --color-soft, swept all usages); (3) 1440px hero
  width 400ing the Next optimizer (blank hero on desktop; added 1440
  to deviceSizes and 82 to qualities).
- Gauntlet blind-critic loops (VLM, labels stripped): menu lost to
  Collins in round 1 (links cramped, muddy bg, heavy bottom bar),
  refined, round 3 the critic picked OUR menu over the Collins
  reference. Home audited against the Target register: tabs, dots,
  arrows, mega spacing and brown text brightness upgraded per verdict.
- Verified in production build: all routes 200, no console errors, no
  horizontal scroll at 320/390/768/1440, menu/dropdown/tabs/carousel/
  filter/accordion/form all interactive, WhatsApp handoff prefilled,
  dark mode toggle, hero 800-weight white on photo, contrast checked
  numerically (soft 7.66:1 on white, brown muted 9.5:1 on cocoa).
- Pushed 8ab3495 to github.com/tangison/fix-eagle; Vercel auto-deploy
  verified live: all routes 200, new wordmark live, AVIF hero 200,
  robots and sitemap 200.

Stage Summary:
- Live revision deployed at
  https://fix-eagle-targis47s-projects.vercel.app
- Menu overlay wins the blind comparison against the Collins bar;
  typography now runs the Target register on exact brand color codes.

Task: Post-revision verification pass; fix any regressions found on the
live deployment.

Work Log:
- Re-verified the deployed revision end to end: all 14 routes plus
  robots/sitemap return 200, 404 works, wordmark reads FIX EAGLE /
  Auctioneers with Investments only in metadata and legal lines, the
  self-hosted Inter variable (100 to 900) loads 200 at 48KB, the
  Collins-style menu overlay opens with featured work column, the
  case-study carousel slides, and desktop mega dropdowns are wired.
- Found a real defect on the brown text-heavy pages: the body:has()
  hooks referenced var(--paper) outside the .theme-brown wrapper, so
  the custom properties resolved to root white. Brown pages rendered a
  white header bar and a 623px white footer outside the cocoa wrapper.
- Fixed by extending the brown token block in tokens.css to target the
  header and footer directly (body:has(.theme-brown) .site-header /
  .site-footer), adding the missing site-footer class hook plus
  text-ink on the footer element (the token override alone does not
  re-declare the inherited color property), and painting the body cocoa
  so overscroll never shows white.
- Also repaired the stale start script still pointing at the dropped
  standalone server output.
- Verified locally on a production build: brown pages paint cocoa
  across header, body, wrapper and footer with ivory ink, gold
  statement, soft 9.54:1, links 12.55:1; dark mode leaves the brown
  theme fixed as designed; home and all light pages unchanged (white
  ground, charcoal ink); no console errors; lint clean.
- Pushed 4963e92 to github.com/tangison/fix-eagle; waited for the
  Vercel auto-deploy and confirmed the fix is live: brown pages now
  carry the cocoa header and footer, light pages untouched.

Stage Summary:
- The brown ground now runs edge to edge on privacy, terms, disclaimer
  and brand; every other page stays on the white base. Live at
  https://fix-eagle-targis47s-projects.vercel.app

Task ID: 5
Agent: Super Z (main agent)
Task: Full rebrand to Oryx Politechnical Institute per the new filebin
assets, gpt-taste skill, Tangison webmaster checklist and a 10/10
optimization pass; deploy with the new tokens.

Work Log:
- Fetched the new filebin (3kemeowrb1p40dx1): Oryx Institute Brand
  Assets (two logo variants, eight print-kit pieces) plus a
  Tangison-New-Skills zip (copywriting, research, scraping, gauntlet,
  checklist, full-output).
- Ran gpt-taste (leonxlnx/taste-skill) and read the full SKILL.md;
  ran the deterministic Python RNG on the prompt (seed 445): Editorial
  Split hero, Geist sans, Horizontal Accordions + Inline Typography
  Images + Artifact Carousel, GSAP Image Scale-Fade + Scrubbing Text
  Reveals.
- Extracted every fact by reading the print kit with VLM: wordmark
  ORYX + 理工 (maroon) + INSTITUTE with maroon shield; Principal Tangi
  Iigonda; P.O. Box 1662 Windhoek; +264 81 341 1522;
  tangi@oryxinstitute.org; oryxinstitute.org; approved lines "Looks
  harmless. Isn't." and "graduates solve problems quietly and finish
  them decisively."; certificate language "excellence in innovation
  and applied problem-solving".
- Decoded the logo SVG into its four paths (ORYX, INSTITUTE, 理工,
  shield) and built the pipeline (scripts/oryx-assets.mjs): React
  path-data component, SVG lockup files, knockout favicons (512, 180,
  maskable 192, multi-size favicon.ico), wolf and ocean photo crops,
  print-kit imagery, OG cards.
- Typography: Tinos (Times-metric serif, the wordmark's own register)
  for display, Geist variable for UI and body, a two-glyph Noto Serif
  SC subset (980 bytes) so 理工 renders as live text.
- Rebuilt the full site: home (editorial-split hero, gapless bento,
  GSAP scrub statement, scale-fade ocean, artifact carousel, night
  CTA band), programmes (horizontal accordion), about, apply
  (WhatsApp-first composer, verified prefilled handoff), faq
  (accordion + FAQPage JSON-LD), brand (anatomy tabs + full print kit
  carousel), ink-themed privacy/terms/disclaimer, 404, error,
  robots, sitemap, manifest, EducationalOrganization JSON-LD.
- Hallmark 58-gate sweep: fixed italic display emphasis (38a), token
  sweep with fixed pill/night tokens and dark-mode accent flips (48),
  night band replaces the full-accent CTA (23), outline-based input
  focus with reserved error slots and shared control heights (39),
  bento breakpoint alignment killing implicit-column overflow at
  640-768px (50), and inline pill crops holding every cold page under
  500KB (432KB home, 478KB brand). Added Hallmark stamps and updated
  .hallmark/log.json.
- Gauntlet blind critic, labels stripped, against the live-fetched
  wearecollins.com reference: OUR home won and OUR menu won.
- Lint clean; tsc clean for src; all routes 200; no console errors;
  no overflow at 320/375/414/640/700/768/1440; hero fits the fold at
  1280x800.
- Preserved the prior remote lineage on archive/pre-rebrand, pushed
  main (eb03470) to github.com/tangison/oryx-institute with the new
  PAT, and deployed through the existing git-linked Vercel project
  with the new token; SSO gate disabled on the vercel.app host.

Stage Summary:
- Live at https://oryx-institute-tangison-s-projects.vercel.app
  (auto-deploys from GitHub main). The vercel.app host stays
  noindexed via src/proxy.ts until oryxinstitute.org is connected as
  a production domain.
- Blind-critic wins against the Collins bar on both home and menu.

Task: Pivot to institute strategy. Run the vercel-labs find-skills flow,
install the requested skill set, read the worklog and map the AI-native
GTM strategy with the founder.

Work Log:
- Ran `npx skills use "https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills" --skill
  "find-skills"`, read the full SKILL.md output, followed its flow:
  search via `npx skills find`, verify install counts and source
  reputation, then install with `-g -y`.

  ogilvy-copywriting (boraoztunc, 424), glm-master-skill (zai-org/glm-skills,
  official source after modelscope.cn registry failed to resolve).
- Read this worklog end to end; grounded all strategy facts in the
  Task 5 rebrand state (brand codes, approved lines, contacts, live
  deployment).
- Web-researched the Namibian market and cited every number: youth
  unemployment 38.05% (2025), 563,499 youth out of the labour force
  (NSA Jan 2025), NTA 45,000 TVET target vs 13,500 latest intake, VET
  levy since 2014, NUST ~10,500 students, entrepreneurship education
  gap in the literature.
- Wrote docs/strategy-map.md: positioning (Stanford-on-steroids
  translation table), the tools motto as strategy, market table, GTM
  per the gtm-strategy framework (segments S1-S4, levy insight,
  messaging pillars, channels, KPIs, 90-day roadmap), four new site
  surfaces (/resources, /compare with non-disparagement rules, /tools,
  /schools with phased coming-soon, /people), staff strategy
  (1 admin + agents, practitioner-teacher two tracks, hiring bar,
  key-person risk), accreditation critical path with publishing
  guardrails, business plan skeleton, 7-risk contingency table,
  skill-to-workflow map, and open items for the founder.

Stage Summary:
- Strategy map live at docs/strategy-map.md on main; founder open
  items listed in its section 10, including the gauntlet bar pick.
- Site surfaces in section 5 are the next build queue; no site code
  changed in this task.
